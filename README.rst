pip-review
==========

*Looking for a new maintainer! See https://github.com/jgonggrijp/pip-review/issues/76.*

``pip-review`` is a convenience wrapper around ``pip``. It can list available updates by deferring to ``pip list --outdated``. It can also automatically or interactively install available updates for you by deferring to ``pip install``.

Example, report-only:

.. code:: console

    $ pip-review
    requests==0.13.4 is available (you have 0.13.2)
    redis==2.4.13 is available (you have 2.4.9)
    rq==0.3.2 is available (you have 0.3.0)

Example, actually install everything:

.. code:: console

    $ pip-review --auto
    ... <pip install output>

Example, run interactively, ask to upgrade for each package:

.. code:: console

    $ pip-review --interactive
    requests==0.14.0 is available (you have 0.13.2)
    Upgrade now? [Y]es, [N]o, [A]ll, [Q]uit y
    ...
    redis==2.6.2 is available (you have 2.4.9)
    Upgrade now? [Y]es, [N]o, [A]ll, [Q]uit n
    rq==0.3.2 is available (you have 0.3.0)
    Upgrade now? [Y]es, [N]o, [A]ll, [Q]uit y
    ...

Example, preview for update target list by ``pip list --outdated`` format, with run interactively or install everything:

.. code:: console

    $ pip-review --interactive --preview
    Package  Version Latest Type
    -----------------------------
    redis    2.4.9   2.6.2  wheel
    requests 0.13.2  0.14.0 wheel
    rq       0.3.0   0.3.4  wheel
    -----------------------------
    ... < --interactive processing >

.. code:: console

    $ pip-review --auto --preview
    ... <same above and pip install output>

Example, preview a table of the update target list, which is a combination of the interactive and preview formats:

.. code:: console

    $ pip-review --preview-only
    Package  Version Latest Type
    -----------------------------
    redis    2.4.9   2.6.2  wheel
    requests 0.13.2  0.14.0 wheel
    rq       0.3.0   0.3.4  wheel
    -----------------------------

Run ``pip-review -h`` for a complete overview of the options.

Note: If you want to pin specific packages to prevent them from automatically
being upgraded, you can use a constraint file (similar to ``requirements.txt``):

.. code:: console

    $ export PIP_CONSTRAINT="${HOME}/constraints.txt
    $ cat $PIP_CONSTRAINT
    pyarrow==0.14.1
    pandas<0.24.0

    $ pip-review --auto
    ...

Set this variable in ``.bashrc`` or ``.zshenv`` to make it persistent.
Alternatively, this option can be specified in ``pip.conf``, e.g.:

* Linux:

.. code:: console

    $ cat ~/.config/pip/pip.conf
    [global]
    constraint = /home/username/constraints.txt
    
* Windows:

.. code:: console

    $ cat $HOME\AppData\Roaming\pip\pip.ini
    [global]
    constraint = '$HOME\Roaming\pip\constraints.txt'

The conf file are dependent of the user, so If you use multiple users you must define config file for each of them.

Since version 0.5, you can also invoke pip-review as ``python -m pip_review``. This can be useful if you are using multiple versions of Python next to each other.

Before version 1.0, ``pip-review`` had its own logic for finding package updates instead of relying on ``pip list --outdated``.

Like ``pip``, ``pip-review`` updates **all** packages, including ``pip`` and ``pip-review``.


Installation
============

To install, simply use pip:

.. code:: console

    $ pip install pip-review

Decide for yourself whether you want to install the tool system-wide, or
inside a virtual env.  Both are supported.


Testing
=======

To test with your active Python version:

.. code:: console

    $ ./run-tests.sh

To test under all (supported) Python versions:

.. code:: console

    $ tox

The tests run quite slow, since they actually interact with PyPI, which
involves downloading packages, etc.  So please be patient.


Origins
=======

``pip-review`` was originally part of pip-tools_ but
has been discontinued_ as such. See `Pin Your Packages`_ by Vincent
Driessen for the original introduction. Since there are still use cases, the
tool now lives on as a separate package.
