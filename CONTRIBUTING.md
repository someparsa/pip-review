# How to contribute to `pip-review`

Please **do** contribute! In fact, please take over! See https://github.com/jgonggrijp/pip-review/issues/76.

I (@jgonggrijp) will not just abondon `pip-review`, but I am not using it anymore myself and I cannot dedicate any time to actively maintaining it, other than accepting pull requests and maybe issueing a new release once in a while. So if you see a way to improve `pip-review`, whether by fixing a bug or by adding a feature, please go ahead and submit a pull request.


## Suggestions

Any kind of contribution is welcome; nothing is "off limits". However, for those who would like some guidance:

  - Look for issues with the [help wanted](https://github.com/jgonggrijp/pip-review/labels/help%20wanted), [question](https://github.com/jgonggrijp/pip-review/labels/question) or [poll](https://github.com/jgonggrijp/pip-review/labels/poll) label. In the latter case, if you have an opinion, vote by adding an emoticon of your choice to the opening post. Feel free to explain your vote in a response or to thumbs-up another response that explains your opinion.
